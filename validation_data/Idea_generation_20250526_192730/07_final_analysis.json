However, the low engagement on HackerNews suggests either a lack of significant unmet need,  poorly defined target audience, or existing solutions already adequately address the market.

      "insights": "Low initial engagement suggests either low demand or poor presentation/title.  The lack of engagement suggests either low interest in this specific problem or that the problem is too broad/niche for HN's audience. Competition is not explicitly mentioned, but the lack of engagement suggests existing solutions might already address this need, or the need itself is not widely felt."
